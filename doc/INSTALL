INSTALL
=======
Copy the whole project to your webserver DocumentRoot.

MODULES
=======
You need the DBD driver for DBI - this is available in every distribution as package.
On Debian just type: # apt-get install libdbi-perl
But you also need a rarely packaged module for syntax highlighting.
In most cases you have to install it about CPAN.
	# perl -MCPAN -e shell
	% install Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate

or if you are on an after Debian Lenny release:
	# apt-get install libsyntax-highlight-engine-kate-perl libwww-perl libgeo-ip-perl

After that you should have everything for pnopaste!

DATABASE
========
Create a new user and database for pnopaste at your MySQL server.
Now import the "sql/mysql_5.sql" to the new database.

CONFIGURATION
=============
Now go to the "conf/" directory and insert your newly created user,
password and databasename (maybe also host) into the SQL_Access.pm.

WEBSERVER
=========
I recommend (for example for Apache2) the following VirtualHost:

<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName      nopaste.yourhost.com
        ServerAdmin     im-the@serveradmin.com
        DocumentRoot    /var/www/pnopaste
        <Directory "/var/www/pnopaste">
                AllowOverride   all
                DirectoryIndex  index.pl
                AddHandler      cgi-script .pl
                Options         Indexes ExecCGI
        </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

Surely you could also use mod_perl instead of cgi.
But you should make sure, that your webserver allows you to overwrite settings, if you don't allow it,
evil users may read out your lib/Database.pm for example and damage you!
That is the reason why I delivered some .htaccess files. :-)

END

Now everything should be done and hopefully working fine!
